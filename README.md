Hi, MemeOverload from Overload lnc. here. This is my second project and again I used PyGame and PyInstaller for this project. Like my previous one this project can also get a False Positive Virus thing so again if you have no problem with that go ahead and download the .exe file. But if you want to make sure it doesn't have a virus or want to mess with the code you can donwload the .py source code.
Note that code requires the textures to run it self. So make sure they are all in the same folder.
